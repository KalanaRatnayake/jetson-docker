## jetson-base:r32.7.1 

This image is an modified [nvcr.io/nvidia/l4t-base:r32.7.1](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/l4t-base/tags). The image has been modified by upgrading core Ubuntu 18.04 to Ubuntu 20.04. 

[dusty-nv/jetson-containers](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-containers) allows building image for Jetson nano but they are based on offical [nvcr.io/nvidia/l4t-base:r32.7.1](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/l4t-base/tags) which is based on Ubuntu 18.04 and is limited by Python 3.6.9. 

Due to this, being inspired from [Qengineering/Jetson-Nano-Ubuntu-20-image](https://github.com/Qengineering/Jetson-Nano-Ubuntu-20-image) and based on [gpshead/Dockerfile](https://gist.github.com/gpshead/0c3a9e0a7b3e180d108b6f4aef59bc19), this image provides an Ubuntu 20.04 version of [nvcr.io/nvidia/l4t-base:r32.7.1](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/l4t-base/tags)

> Ubuntu 22.04 was also attempted, but later abandoned due to lack of support for gcc-8, g++8 and clang-8 required by CUDA 10.2 in r32.7.1
